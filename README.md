# Roblox auto signup

A tool that auto fetch a temporary email address and creates an account at https://roblox.com/.

## How it works

The process begins by utilizing the [Mail.tm](https://mail.tm/) service to obtain a temporary email address. Then it will create an [Roblox](https://roblox.com) account. The email address is then utilized for verification for the [Roblox](https://roblox.com) account. Subsequently, another request is made to [Mail.tm](https://mail.tm/) to retrieve the email confirmation link. Upon activation of the account, the user is able to log in to Roblox and enjoy the game with the account generated.


## Features

- Able to use any Chromium-based browser.
- Able to use non authenticated proxy.
- Be able to prompt to change to your own password instead of using the default one.
- Password complexity checker for custom password.
- Automatically checks if the username generated is taken or not. If yes, a new one would be generated.
- Customizable username prefix.
- Able to randomly customize the account avatar (Clothes, Body size, etc)
- Error handling.
- Compatible with [Roblox Account Manager](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager)
- Structured username format
- Update checker functionality.
- The script does all the job by itself.
- No webdriver required.
- Fast execution time.

> **Warning**
> The script does not solves FunCaptcha from Roblox, I haven't found an efficient way to do so. For now, you have to solve it by yourself.

## Installation / Usage

#### 1. Portable executable method:
- Just download the executable from the [releases tab](https://github.com/qing762/roblox-auto-signup/releases) and run it to generate accounts.

- The account details should be generated at the `accounts.txt` file under the same directory.

 ``` shell
 https://www.python.org/downloads/

 ```

And you're all set! Follow the instructions while interacting with the Python file.
